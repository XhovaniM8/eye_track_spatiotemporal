# DVS Denoising Pipeline

This project implements a denoising pipeline for Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event data using multiple approaches: a spatiotemporal filtering algorithm based on the HOTS model from Lagorce et al. ("HOTS: A hierarchy of event-based time-surfaces for pattern recognition," Neural Networks, 2016), and a novel spike-based denoising approach using the Axon SDK neuromorphic simulation framework. The NumPy/Numba implementation is optimized to achieve real-time or near real-time performance on modern hardware, processing approximately 102,000 events per second on an Apple M1 Pro with 32GB of RAM.

## Pipeline Workflows

### Traditional HOTS-based Denoising
The traditional pipeline workflow begins by loading event data from an HDF5 file and converting it into a list of event dictionaries. These events are then passed through a denoising function that applies a temporally bounded, spatially local filtering strategy. Each event is evaluated based on its spatiotemporal neighborhood, using exponential decay weights for both spatial and temporal distance. Events are retained if their computed activity exceeds a specified threshold.

### Spike-based Neuromorphic Denoising
The spike-based approach uses the Axon SDK to create a three-layer spiking neural network (input → filter → output) that spatially maps DVS events to individual neurons. Each DVS event triggers burst spikes in corresponding input neurons, which propagate through the network layers using biologically-inspired dynamics. The network performs spatial denoising through synaptic connectivity and temporal filtering through membrane dynamics.

Following denoising in both approaches, the filtered events are converted into grayscale video frames using a time-based binning strategy, and the resulting frame stack is exported as an MP4 video using imageio/OpenCV. The process also records performance metrics including total runtime, number of events retained and removed, and number of frames generated. These metrics are saved to CSV files for later analysis.

## Algorithms

### HOTS-based Algorithm
For each event `i` at position `(x_i, y_i)` and time `t_i`:

```
D_i = ∑_{j < i, Δt ≤ τ_d} exp(-Δt / τ_n) × exp(-((x_j - x_i)² + (y_j - y_i)²) / (2σ_n²))
```

Event retained if `D_i ≥ δ_d`.

### Spike-based Algorithm
The spike-based approach implements a spatial spiking neural network where:

1. **Spatial Mapping**: Each pixel (x,y) maps to three neurons: input, filter, output
2. **Event Injection**: DVS events trigger 3-spike bursts in corresponding input neurons
3. **Signal Propagation**: Spikes propagate through layers via weighted synaptic connections
4. **Membrane Dynamics**: Leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with configurable thresholds
5. **Output Extraction**: Output layer spikes form the denoised event stream

**Network Parameters**:
- Input threshold: Vt=3, Filter/Output threshold: Vt=2
- Synaptic weights: 15.0 (strong coupling for reliable propagation)
- Membrane time constant: tm=15ms, Synaptic time constant: tf=3ms
- Synaptic delays: 0.1ms (minimal for fast processing)

### Implementation Analysis

**Core Function**: `denoise_events()` with Numba JIT compilation for performance

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Event Extraction**: Convert event list to numpy arrays (times, x, y coordinates)
2. **Temporal Sorting**: Sort events by timestamp for chronological processing
3. **Numba Acceleration**: JIT-compiled `_fast_denoise_numba()` for O(n) processing
4. **Rolling Window**: Bounded backward search (max 10,000 events) within `tau_d` window
5. **Spatial Filtering**: Early termination for events outside 3×3 spatial neighborhood
6. **Activity Calculation**: Exponential decay weights for temporal and spatial distance
7. **Order Restoration**: Map filtered results back to original event ordering

**Optimizations**:
- Numba JIT compilation for ~100x speedup over pure Python
- Bounded lookback prevents O(n²) complexity for dense event streams  
- Spatial early termination (|dx|,|dy| ≤ 1) reduces unnecessary computations
- Temporal break condition stops search when `dt > tau_d`

**Complexity**: O(n·k) where k ≪ n due to bounded search window
